# HCalConfigs
HGCROC Configuration Files

## Directory Structure

The lundTestbench/ directory contains though-out configurations for the testbench in Lund, that are recommended to use or shows some interesting behaviour. 

The dumps/ directory holds full dumps of all internal registers, marked with a timestamp but may otherwise be nondescript. Feel free to just put your temporary files here. 

## TODO
We should have a system/procedure for metadata that contain at least some descriptions of what the configuration file accomplishes, and it would be great for every configuration file to come with a set of descriptive measurements (maybe even material for some plots) taken with that configuration. The eventual goal is to facilitate easy diagnostics of the readout with the whole detector connected.
